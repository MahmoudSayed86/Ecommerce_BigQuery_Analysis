This project aims to analyze the Looker E-commerce dataset available at Looker E-commerce BigQuery Dataset | Kaggle. The dataset consists of various data sources related to e-commerce, including order data, user data, and profit data.

The project focuses on merging different datasets to obtain comprehensive order data and performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the final-order data. Additionally, it merges the final order data with the user data to calculate the profit per user and conducts EDA on the final profit data per user.

To further enhance the analysis, the project utilizes the K-means clustering model to cluster users based on their profit. This allows for a deeper understanding of user segments and their corresponding profitability.

By analyzing this rich e-commerce dataset and performing various data manipulations, exploratory analysis, and clustering, the project aims to uncover valuable insights and patterns within the data.

Feel free to explore the project code and data to gain a comprehensive understanding of the analysis performed.
